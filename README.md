# PythonPhotoProject

An application to help with curating the tens of thousands of photos a user has on their hard drive.

Ultimately - to display the photos like the Windows native screen saver does but also to allow the user to inspect any given photo that appears.

One of the major issues is the photos appearing in the correct aspect and the right way up!
